# OZDS user documentation

This portion of the documentation is meant for the end users of the OZDS web
application. This documentation outlines all functionality and features of the
OZDS web application divided for certain roles of users:

- [Tenants](docs/user/operator/index.md)
- [Subnets](docs/user/operator/index.md)
- [Operators](docs/user/operator/index.md)

The [admin](docs/user/admin/index.md) portion describes all functionality and
features for administrators of the application. These are not considered end
users and are usually DevOps developers.
