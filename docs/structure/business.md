# [`Ozds.Business`](src/Ozds.Business)

This project contains all of the backend logic of the server. Every function in
this project is tested in the `Ozds.Business.Test` project. Logic is divided
into functions kept in services conceptually similar to each other (ie. all
logic for meters will be kept in the Meters service).
