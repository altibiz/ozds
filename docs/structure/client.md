# [`Ozds.Client`](src/Ozds.Client)

This project holds all the UI pages and reusable components needed to render the
UI. Pages are kept in the `Pages` namespace and reusable components are kept in
the `Shared` namespace. Pages in the `Pages` namespace should be kept at minimum
complexity, should contain only one route, and most UI logic should be kept in
the reusable components. Reusable components should only contain UI logic and
any backend logic should be kept in the `Ozds.Business` project.
