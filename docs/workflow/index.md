# Workflows

Workflows are series of actions the server or developer takes that implement a
specific functionality. These are a great way to show how data flows through the
application. Workflows that showcase server functionality are:

- [Auditing](docs/workflow/auditing.md)
- [Billing](docs/workflow/billing.md)
- [Push](docs/workflow/push.md)

Workflows that involve users are:

- [Login](docs/workflow/login.md)
- [Moderation](docs/workflow/moderation.md)

Workflows that involve developers are:

- [Deployment](docs/workflow/deployment.md)
- [Faking](docs/workflow/faking.md)
- [Migration](docs/workflow/migration.md)
