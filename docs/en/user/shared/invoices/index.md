## Invoices Table

This table shows all invoices the current user can oversee.

The user can see the name of the network user this invoice is directed at, the
total amount in EUR, the start and end of the time span that was used in the
issuing of this invoice, and the invoice number.

By pressing the inspect button, the user can see a more detailed overview of the
invoice and even print it out.
