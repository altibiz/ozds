## Dashboard

Here the user can see aggregated consumption measurement data for the current
month, the previous month, and a graph of consumption over longer periods. Below
the aggregated values is a table of measurement locations showing the
consumption of individual measurement locations in the current and previous
month, and the calculation totals in the previous month.

By clicking on the names of locations, network users, or measurement locations,
users are redirected to a detailed overview of these entities. Locations and
network users redirect to a review of user data and privileges. Clicking on
measurement locations redirects to a detailed overview of individual measurement
locations.
